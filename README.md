This project is a front-end implementation of a food delivery website, completed as a home assignment for Josh Technology Group (JTG). The goal was to build a pixel-perfect, responsive, and interactive webpage using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following the provided Figma design.

## Features Implemented

This project includes a wide range of features to create a modern, user-friendly experience:

-   **Fully Responsive Design:** The layout is optimized for a seamless experience on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones, using clean CSS media queries.
-   **Interactive Carousel:** The "Popular Items" section features a touch-friendly, autoplaying carousel built with the **Swiper.js** library (as permitted by the assignment).
-   **Video Player Controls:** The video in the "Blog" section can be played and paused by clicking on it, with the play icon correctly showing and hiding.
-   **Request a Dish Modal:** A fully functional modal pops up when the "Request a Dish" button is clicked.
-   **Locked Background Scroll:** When the modal is open, the main page body behind it is not scrollable, ensuring a focused user experience.
-   **Smooth Scrolling Navigation:** Clicking on the navigation links in the header and footer smoothly scrolls the page to the corresponding section.
-   **Interactive UI Elements:**
    -   Buttons and navigation links have hover effects.
    -   "Add to Cart" buttons provide visual feedback upon being clicked.
    -   A functional quantity selector (`+` / `-`) is included on one of the cards.
-   **Semantic and Modern HTML5:** The project is built with a logical structure using tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
-   **Professional CSS:** Uses modern techniques like CSS Variables for theme colors, Flexbox, and Grid for layout.

## Technologies Used

This project was built adhering strictly to the assignment's technical constraints.

-   **HTML5**
-   **CSS3** (with Flexbox, Grid, and CSS Variables)
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**
-   **Swiper.js** (for the carousel, as allowed)

**No CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap) or JavaScript frameworks (like React, Angular) were used.**
